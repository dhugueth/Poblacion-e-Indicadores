### Data Preparation

Modifications were made to the original data using the Power Query editor to be able to use them appropriately. 

The modifications were: 

- 
- 
- The column "Ventas global" was eliminated because it generates a duplication in the values.
- Four columns were unified to two columns, with the option "Unpivot columns", in order to have all the sales values together in a column and the regions in another column.
- Original region names were replaced  for more understandability.  
- The type of field assigned by Power BI to the column "a√±o" was changed to be consistent with the desired purposes.
